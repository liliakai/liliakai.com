                           Electron, React, browser extensions, web development,

                <h2>Experience</h2>

                <h3>Bellingcat</h3>
                <p>October 2023 - Present</p>
                <p>
                  Bellingcat is an independent international collective of
                  researchers, investigators and citizen journalists using open
                  source and social media investigation to probe a variety of
                  subjects. As a software developer at Bellingcat, I work on
                  developing and maintaining web apps and APIs to support
                  researchers in their investigations. This includes
                  interfaces for archiving of social media and websites,
                  image analysis, other online research tools.
                </p>
                <h3>Awala</h3>
                <p>March 2021 - May 2021</p>
                <p>
                  Awala is a suite of apps combined with a backend service which
                  enables the secure transmission of network traffic from areas
                  experiencing internet blackouts, blockages, and other forms of
                  censorship. I produced the frontend of the desktop app for
                  Awala using Electron and React while working closely with a
                  backend engineer who developed the underlying encryption and
                  transmission libraries.
                </p>
                <h3>PhishDetect</h3>
                <p>April 2019 - March 2020</p>
                  <p>
                    PhishDetect is an email-scanning browser extension that
                    looks for malware indicators in received emails and
                    generates warnings for the user as well as submitting the
                    content to a server for further analysis. As an extension of
                    the work I previously completed on Suspicious Email
                    Submitter, I worked closely with he PhishDetect and MISP
                    teams to integrate these tools as well as refactoring the
                    PhishDetect UI to use modular React components.
                </p>

                <h3>Suspicious Email Submitter</h3>
                <p>January 2018 - September 2018</p>
                <p> Developed and shipped extensions for Chrome, Firefox, and Thunderbird for submission of suspected-phishing emails
                to a backend malware data collection service known as MISP.
                </p>
                <h3>Signal</h3>

                <p>October 2014 - October 2017</p>

                <p><a href=https://signal.org>Signal</a> is an encrypted chat
                client aimed at making mass surveillance impossible. The Signal protocol
                represents the gold standard for end-to-end encrypted messaging on both mobile
                and desktop platforms, and is now integrated directly into multiple major
                social networks including WhatsApp, Facebook Messenger, and Google Allo. For
                two years, I was the sole developer of the desktop version of Signal. I
                performed extensive refactoring and maintainence of the javascript protocol
                library and built the front-end for the desktop app from scratch using Electron.

                presents a two-part web game series featuring a murderous sentient armored tank
                armed only with a giant knife. I served as the primary coder on both games,
                which represent one of my earliest forays into HTML and Javascript. The
                original game was prototyped in Java, then ported and finished in Javascript
                using Processing.js. Originally conceived as part of a one-day hackathon, each
                game was developed in approximately 24 hours.</p>

                Francisco. As the company's sole software developer at the time, I was
                responsible for maintaining and extending a collection of proprietary software
                written in C++ and Python, including programs for multi-camera video capture,
                3D reconstruction, and distributed computing.</p>
