                <p><a href=http://www.causes.com>Causes.com</a> is an online platform for philanthropy and activism written in Ruby on Rails. As a software engineer I participated in full-stack web development, including front and back end feature development, production database migrations, and scaling to accomodate millions of users.</p>

                <h3>Knifetanks</h3>
                <p>July/November 2010<p>
                <p><a href=http://www.knifetanks.com>Knifetanks.com</a> presents a two-part web game series featuring a murderous sentient armored tank armed only with a giant knife. I served as the primary coder on both games, which represent one of my earliest forays into HTML and Javascript. The original game was prototyped in Java, then ported and finished in Javascript using Processing.js. Originally conceived as part of a one-day hackathon, each game was developed in approximately 24 hours.</p> 
                <h3>Mova</h3>
                <p>November 2009 - June 2010</p>
                <p>Mova is a 3D facial motion capture studio located in San Francisco. As the company's sole software developer at the time, I was responsible for maintaining and extending a collection of proprietary software written in C++ and Python, including programs for multi-camera video capture, 3D reconstruction, and distributed computing.</p>

                <h3>OnLive</h3>
